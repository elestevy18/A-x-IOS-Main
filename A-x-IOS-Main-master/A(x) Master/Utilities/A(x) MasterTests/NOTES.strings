So I didnt know any better in builkding the MVP and typed away some smelly smelly code.
It is redemption time and these are the notes I need to Refactor the codes.
 
 
GOAL 1: I want to add a workout generator
 
 CONSIDERATIONS
 I want to add splits and time support in the future.// Meso cycles too
 For now I will stick to the prescreptivist approach and recommend 1 hour at a time.
 
 INFORMATION
 
 Time/Set:
 Isolateral:

IMPLEMENTATION
 
 Make a class that retrieves an exercises values. All computed when necessary
 
 ALGORITHM
 
 
 1 - find the muscle furthest from it' maximum and start the workout there
        If there are more than
            -To track what is the missing volume by percetage we store this value in memory
 2- Find missing volume of neighboring muscles
 
 EXERCISE PROPERTIES
 
 CLASS EXERCISE {
        title: String
        neigbors:[muscle]
        primaryMovers: [muscles]
        
 }
 
 enum Muscle {
 //TODO import all muscle groups
 }
 
 class muscle {
    
 }

 
 LAYOUTS:
            WORKOUT:
                    Make a list view [stack]. add an big action button at the bottom
 
 The top row displays the current exercise/ rest.
 The rest time is white when the regular rest is active.
 Glows green when you should start a set.
 Turns red if you rested too long
